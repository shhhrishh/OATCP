Function maxIceCream:

This function takes two arguments: vector of integers costs representing the costs of ice creams, and an integer coins representing the number of coins available.
It initializes a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of ice creams bought.
It sorts the costs vector in ascending order using sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());.
It then iterates through the sorted costs:
If the current ice cream's cost is less than or equal to the remaining coins (coins), it subtracts the cost from coins and increments count.
If the cost exceeds the remaining coins, it breaks the loop since no more ice creams can be bought with the remaining coins.
Finally, it returns the count of bought ice creams.
