The code implements a solution to count the number of ways to construct sum n by throwing a dice one or more times using dynamic programming.

1) Dynamic Programming Function solve():

   ->This function calculates the number of ways to represent the given number N as the sum of numbers from 1 to 6, modulo 10^9+7. It initializes an array dp[] of 
   size N+1 to store the results of subproblems. dp[i] represents the number of ways to represent i as the sum of numbers from 1 to 6.
   ->Base Case: dp[0] = 1 because there is only one way to represent 0, i.e., using no numbers.
   ->Iterating over i from 1 to N, it iterates over all possible numbers from 1 to 6 (or less if i is less than 6) and calculates dp[i] as the sum of dp[i - j] for 
    all j from 1 to 6.
   ->Finally, it returns dp[N], which represents the number of ways to represent N as the sum of numbers from 1 to 6.

2) Main Function:

    ->It reads the input N.
    ->It initializes an empty vector v.
    ->It reads N integers into the vector v.
    ->For each element v[i] in the vector: If v[i] is less than or equal to 0, it prints 0 because there are no valid ways to represent negative numbers or 0 as the 
     the sum of numbers from 1 to 6. Otherwise, it calls the solve() function to calculate the number of ways to represent v[i] as the sum of numbers from 1 to 6 and 
     prints the result.
