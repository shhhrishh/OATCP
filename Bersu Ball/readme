Main Function: 

          1) It declares variables n and m to store the number of boys and girls, respectively.
          2) It takes input for the heights of boys and girls into vectors boys and girls, respectively.
          3) Sort the heights of boys and girls in ascending order using the sort function from the <algorithm> library.
                  a) It initializes pairs to 0 and two indices i and j to 0.
                  b) It uses a while loop to compare heights of boys and girls.
                  c) If the absolute difference between the current boy's height and girl's height is at most 1, it increments pairs and moves both indices forward 
                  (i++ and j++).
                  d) If the boy's height is less than the girl's height, it increments only i.
                  e) If the boy's height is greater than the girl's height, it increments only j.
          4) It prints the number of pairs (pairs) where the height difference is at most 1.
